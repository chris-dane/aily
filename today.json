  "question": "Is there life on Mars?",
  "ai_output": "There is no confirmed evidence of life on Mars today, but scientists continue to investigate the possibility. Mars has conditions that were once more favourable, with evidence of liquid water on its surface billions of years ago and signs of ancient rivers, lakes, and possibly oceans. Today, the planet is cold, dry, and has a thin atmosphere, making surface life unlikely. However, microbial life may have existed in the past or could persist underground, protected from radiation. Robotic missions like NASA’s Perseverance rover are searching for biosignatures, and future missions may provide clearer answers about Mars’ potential habitability.",
